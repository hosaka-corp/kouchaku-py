Experiment with doing transformations on verbal constructions in Japanese.
I have no serious/formal/academic background in language, so don't take this 
as anything more than "very sloppy note-taking," or "an experiment." There are
a lot of distinctions made here which are probably un-necessary for doing 
practical things in this direction. 
This is mostly a vehicle for me to learn [albeit, in a very roundabout way].

This is largely based on notes from [Pomax'](https://github.com/Pomax) excellent book:
[An Introduction to Japanese Syntax, Grammar & Language](https://pomax.github.io/nrGrammar)

Currently, this project depends on:

- [`mecab`](https://github.com/taku910/mecab)
- [`mecab-python3`](https://github.com/SamuraiT/mecab-python3)
- [`mecab-ipadic-neologd`](https://github.com/neologd/mecab-ipadic-neologd)

See usage example in [test.py](test.py)
